On some machines it may be that pyusb from pypi is not a recent enough version. If your block connects to the Blink1 device but is unable to fade the colors, try installing from [source](https://github.com/walac/pyusb). In addition to this, you can also try a [newer version](https://github.com/todbot/blink1) of blink1. This todbot repo is the official repo for thingm, yet it is not the one on pypi.",
